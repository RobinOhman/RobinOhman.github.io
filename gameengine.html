						<p class="display">
						A simple game engine I built in C++ for an assignment.
						</p>
						<p class="display">
						It supports object creation, collision physics, sound, animation and custom key bindings.
						It features simpleton patterns for textures to minimize the amount of SDL the user needs to interact with, while also preventing multiple instances of the same file being stored.
						</p>
						<p class="display">
						Since C++ doesn't have automatic garbage deletion, you would normally need to delete the sprites from each object individually when closing the game. I didn't like that however, which is why I went for
						the simpleton approach. Using that I only need to delete one of each sprite at the end of the game, without checking every object for their sprites.
						</p>
						<p class="display">
						I also put a lot of effort into separating SDL2 from the game engine itself, as having the hypothetical "game developer" go through the process required to create a texture
						every time felt very inefficient. That is why I designed it so that the developer only needs to enter the filename, and then let the texture manager do the rest.
						It uses a Map that stores the textures, with the filepath string being the key. This allows it to check if the texture already exists when a new objects tries to use it.
						</p>
						<p class="display">
						I used a similiar system for the renderer, so that every object could easily access it when needed.
						</p>
