						A simple game engine I built in C++ for an assignment.<br>
						<br>
						It supports object creation, collision physics, sound, animation and custom key bindings.<br>
						It features simpleton patterns for textures to minimize the amount of SDL the user needs to interact with, while also preventing multiple instances of the same file being stored.<br>
						<br>
						Since C++ doesn't have automatic garbage deletion, you would normally need to delete the sprites from each object individually when closing the game. I didn't like that however, which is why I went for
						the simpleton approach. Using that I only need to delete one of each sprite at the end of the game, without checking every object for their sprites.<br>
						<br>
						I also put a lot of effort into separating SDL2 from the game engine itself, as having the hypothetical "game developer" go through the process required to create a texture
						every time felt very inefficient. That is why I designed it so that the developer only needs to enter the filename, and then let the texture manager do the rest.<br>
						It uses a Map that stores the textures, with the filepath string being the key. This allows it to check if the texture already exists when a new objects tries to use it.<br>
						<br>
						I used a similiar system for the renderer, so that every object could easily access it when needed.<br>
